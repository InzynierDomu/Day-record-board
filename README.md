## Description
Scoreboard design, from P10 LED matrices. 6 Day counters, and streak record. Each counter can be reset to zero. Every day all 6 counters are incremented by 1.

## Manual

Resetting the counter and adjust the clock requires an IR pilot.
After turn on the device starts in normal mode, shows counter values â€‹â€‹and streak record.

### Resetting-counter

- To enter the counter reset mode, select the back button (reverse arrow) on the pilot in the normal mode.
- Use the keys 1 to 7 to select the counter to be reset (7 is for record counter).
- The value will appear on the board where the record streak is in normal mode.
- The play button accepts and resets the counter.
- The back button cancels the action and returns to normal mode.

### Adjust-clock

- Pressing the play button in normal mode takes to the clock adjust mode.
- The last screen displays the hour, the penultimate one the minutes.
- The value that can be changed is flashing.
- To change the hours to minutes and vice versa, press the next button.
- To enter a new value of the flashing value, enter the next digits using the buttons. Entering the next digits will overwrite it. The format is hh-mm, e.g. 14.05.
- Press the play button again to accept the time change.
- The back button cancels the action and returns to normal mode.

### Set_manual_counter

- Pressing the next button in normal mode takes to the manual set counter mode.
- With next/previus button change counter to edit.
- To enter a new value of the flashing value, enter the next digits using the buttons. Entering the next digits will overwrite old value. e.g. press 3,2,1 set 123
- Press the play button to accept the change.
- The back button cancels the action and returns to normal mode.

### Config_files

TBD

## Scheme
## IDE
The project is prepared for the Platform IO environment. A video on how to install such an environment can be watched on this [video PL](https://youtu.be/Em9NuebT2Kc).
<br><br>

To upload software, the UART connection between Arduino must be disconnected

If you don't have an environment and don't want to prepare it, you can use the autodeply.bat script, which will configure everything and, if the board is connected to the computer, will load the project. You need only instaled Python and an Internet connection.

Formatting is done using clang-format. The description of the tool configuration is in the [video PL](https://youtu.be/xxuaOG0WjIE).
